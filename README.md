Movies data analysis and Recommendation System in Python

This is a project of a course called "Computational Tools for Data Science" at DTU. 

A simple movie recommendation system where the system takes a movie as input and recommends a list of similar movies. The similarity between movies was measured by considering correlation of ratings between movies. 
Apart from this an exploratory data analysis and machine learning model for movie genre classification also has been performed. The more interesting part of this project was to uses of numpy vectorization to make the computation process faster.

**Notebbok: 02807_Project_1_Md_Alamgir_Kabir** Contains the questions, answers, code for data cleaning, analysis and visualizations and a recommender system.
